### #1 skytalks: January 16th 2018, Gliwice
#### Event page: https://skygate.io/skyhacks/1-skytalks/
##### 1. [Karthik Muthuswamy - SAP, Google Developer Expert for Machine Learning](#talks-karthik-sap)
##### 2. [Jair Ribeiro - Volvo Group](#talks-jair-volvo)
##### 3. [Andrew Morgan - Aon Centre for Innovation and Analytics](#talks-andrew-aon)

**Speaker:** <a name="talks-karthik-sap"> </a> Karthik Muthuswamy - ML Researcher at SAP, Google Developer Expert for Machine Learning

**Title:** Build and Serve Machine Learning Models in the Browser using TensorFlowJS – learn how to build a neural network on a browser.

**Slides:** 

**Summary:**
The goal of this talk was to introduce development of machine learning applications using JavaScript and Python. Participants learnt how to use TensorFlow to train and deploy a trained model directly from the browser, using Google’s training infrastructure. Participants who were new to machine learning learnt basics concepts of machine learning while participants who already had some basic knowledge of machine learning learnt about how to leverage Google’s training resources to speedup training and create machine learning applications on the browser.

**Title:** Mitigating the fear of AI.

**Slides:** https://github.com/SkyhacksPL/Talks/blob/master/_1-skytalks/Mitigating%20the%20Fear%20of%20AI.pdf https://github.com/SkyhacksPL/Talks/blob/master/_1-skytalks/Mitigating%20the%20Fear%20of%20AI.pptx

**Summary:**
This speech aimed to bring insights about the impacts of AI and the capabilities of humanity to respond to them, creating reflection spaces to observe, reflect and debate the issues. The emergence of every disruptive new technology requires new rules: how do we deal with Artificial Intelligence?


**Speaker:** <a name="talks-andrew-aon"> </a> Andrew Morgan - Director, Head of Data Services, Aon Centre for Innovation and Analytic. Former Senior Technologist & Solutions Architect @ Thomson Reuters

**Title:** Evolving AI: Examining TensorFlow accelerated genetic algorithms.

**Slides:** 

**Summary:**
The goal of this talk was to introduce ideas around TensorFlow accelerated Genetic Algorithms, reviewing an introductory use case for classification and regression using Karoo_GP, a tool for GPU accelerated Evolutionary Algorithms in Python.


**Speaker:** <a name="talks-arek-lekta"> </a> Arek Flinik - CTO & Co-founder at Lekta.ai

**Title:** Chatbots: are we all doing it wrong?

**Slides:** 

**Summary:**
Why does talking to chatbots and virtual assistants feel like reading a sophisticated FAQ rather than a productive conversation?
It’s simple: because we build them like that. But we can provide a better user experience if we change how we create them. He shared his experiences and ideas for a different approach to building chatbots.
