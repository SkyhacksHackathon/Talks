“Mining software development history: approaches and challenges”

**Abstract▮**
Software development history, typically represented as a Version Control System log, is a rich source of insights into how the project evolved, as well as how its developers worked. What’s probably more important is that events from the past can predict the future. This talk gives fun history mining examples and presents some of the available tooling. The involved topics include graph embeddings, manifold learning, dynamic time warping, seriation, and modern clustering algorithms.
